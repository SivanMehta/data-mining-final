# Introduction

- Describing your data set
- What is the problem you are trying to solve?

# EDA and unsupervised analysis

- Exploration of your data, including unsupervised analysis. 
- Should provide proper motivation for your work
- Explain any insights and exploration that led to your features and models
- Can include unsupervised approaches that we learned in the last part of the term if you detect any interesting structure with them.
- If you don’t find anything interesting, then just describe what you tried
    - You don’t need to artificially manipulate the data to find something that’s not there.

# Supervised analysis

- How did you make your predictions? Describe this process in detail. 
- You can use any of the classification techniques that we learned in the first half of the course, or any other techniques as long as they are adequately described. 
- What predictor variables did you include? How did you engineer features from the data? What technique did you use for prediction, and why did you choose it? 
- If there were tuning parameters, how did you pick their values? Can you explain anything about the nature of the relationship between the predictors in your model and the predictions themselves?
